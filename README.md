# Retinal_Image_Classification
This project uses deep learning to classify retinal images into three categories: normal, cataract, and glaucoma. With a focus on AI for healthcare, the project implements advanced techniques like CLAHE contrast enhancement and ESRGAN super-resolution to preprocess images and leverages state-of-the-art DenseNet-121 for accurate disease prediction.
